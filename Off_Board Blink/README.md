# Offboard Blink

The purpose of the offboard blink programs in this section is to show that the processor can still be used when disconnected from its dev board.

The program downloaded on the G2553 is the same MSP430G2553 program used in the multi_blink section of this lab. Explaination of that code can be seen there.

A circuit diagram can be seen
